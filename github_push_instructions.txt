# GitHub Repository Push Instructions

After creating your GitHub repository, run the following commands to push your local repository:

## If you created a repository named "SPATRAC-Rebuild" under your GitHub username:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/Manakin-Wraith/SPATRAC-Rebuild.git

# Push your local repository to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace "YOUR_USERNAME" with your actual GitHub username.

## If you're using SSH instead of HTTPS:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote using SSH
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/SPATRAC-Rebuild.git

# Push your local repository to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## If you encounter authentication issues:

For HTTPS connections, you may need to use a personal access token instead of your password.
Visit: https://github.com/settings/tokens to create a token with the "repo" scope.

## To verify your remote repository is set up correctly:

```bash
git remote -v
```

This should display the URLs for your remote repository.
